> An open-source, document-native, ready-to-use Agent Harness for keeping Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other coding agents clear, transparent, and reviewable during long-running software work.

## What It Is

Coding Agent Harness is a project engineering framework for AI coding agents.

It adds working agreements, document structure, task lifecycle, regression evidence, and review loops directly into your repository so agents can read, execute, update, and verify the project from durable local facts.

## Why It Exists

Generating a few thousand lines of code with AI is not the hard part. The hard part is keeping the agent oriented after days of work, preventing parallel agents from overwriting each other, and letting a new agent continue from repository facts instead of chat memory.

Coding Agent Harness turns those facts into part of the project.

## Core Strengths

### Open Source, Simple, Ready To Use

Harness runs as ordinary project files: Markdown, templates, check scripts, and a static dashboard. The core package has no third-party runtime dependencies and does not require a background service or database.

Give the installation prompt to your agent, and it can initialize, scan, migrate, and verify the target project.

### Compatible With Coding Agents

Any agent that can read files, write files, and run commands can use this Harness. It works with Codex, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor-style agents, OpenClaw, and similar coding agents.

### Document-Native And Transparent

Important project state stays visible in the repository:

- what the current task is
- why it matters
- how it should be executed
- where the evidence is
- whether regression passed
- what residual risks remain
- which tasks are complete and which still need work

Humans can read briefs, dashboards, and migration reports. Agents can read structured docs, task contracts, and check results.

### Built For Long-Running Work

Harness covers the continuity layer of real development: task lifecycle, Brief, Execution Strategy, Visual Map, Progress Log, Review, Regression Evidence, Closeout, and Lessons.

It gives each agent step context, evidence, and a finish condition.

### Safe Migration For Existing Projects

Legacy project migration starts with a scan, a migration plan, a recommended migration mode, and user confirmation. Only then should the agent write files. Final status is proven with a dashboard and checks.

## Good Fit

Coding Agent Harness is useful for:

- teams using coding agents on real software projects;
- projects that run for days, weeks, or many iterations;
- work involving multiple agents or multiple developers;
- repositories with historical task docs, regression records, or migration notes;
- teams that want AI development to be visible, reviewable, and reusable.

## Quick Start

### Install The Skill

If your agent supports Skills, install this Skill with `npx`:

```bash
npx skills add FairladyZ625/coding-agent-harness --list
npx skills add FairladyZ625/coding-agent-harness --skill coding-agent-harness
```

Install it into the global Codex skill directory:

```bash
npx skills add FairladyZ625/coding-agent-harness \
  --skill coding-agent-harness \
  --agent codex \
  --global \
  -y
```

The CLI is not automatically added to the target project's dependencies. Use `npx` when you need to run Harness commands:

```bash
npx --yes coding-agent-harness init --locale zh-CN --capabilities core,dashboard .
npx --yes coding-agent-harness check --profile target-project .
```

If `harness` is already installed globally or exposed by the Skill, replace `npx --yes coding-agent-harness` with `harness`.

### Ask The Agent To Run It

Send this to the agent inside your target project:

```text
Install and read Coding Agent Harness first:

npx skills add FairladyZ625/coding-agent-harness --skill coding-agent-harness

If this environment does not have the harness command, run CLI commands with:
npx --yes coding-agent-harness <command>

Set up Coding Agent Harness in the current project.
Use Chinese templates by default. If the project is clearly an English team or English documentation project, ask me before switching to English.

First diagnose the project structure, then give me an initialization plan.
If this is a microservice, multi-repo, split frontend/backend, or externally integrated project, proactively ask me whether I have external architecture docs, API docs, diagrams, meeting notes, links, source paths, or exported packets.
If the external material is large, create an external-source-packs index and digests first, then project stable conclusions into 03-ARCHITECTURE / 04-DEVELOPMENT / 06-INTEGRATIONS.
After confirmation, execute Diagnose → Decide → Scaffold → Configure → Verify → Deliver.
When initializing, run:
npx --yes coding-agent-harness init --locale zh-CN --capabilities core,dashboard .

Do not overwrite existing business docs, historical tasks, regression records, or user changes.
When finished, report created files, check results, and recommended next steps.
```

If the target already has an older Harness, use this:

```text
Install and read Coding Agent Harness first:

npx skills add FairladyZ625/coding-agent-harness --skill coding-agent-harness

If this environment does not have the harness command, run CLI commands with:
npx --yes coding-agent-harness <command>

This project already has an older Harness. Do not edit files yet.

First run a detailed scan and give me a migration plan:
1. Check git status, Harness status, task count, brief coverage, visual_map coverage, warnings/actions/residuals, strict status, and dashboard usability.
2. If this is a microservice, multi-repo, split frontend/backend, or externally integrated project, proactively ask me for external source material; when the material is large, create an external-source-packs index and digests before projecting facts into 03/04/06.
3. Recommend the migration mode from project evidence:
   - baseline-preserve: safe adoption first; only add necessary structure and visibility.
   - status-aware-rewrite: rewrite current or reopened tasks from SSoT, Ledger, progress, review, and git evidence.
   - full-semantic-rewrite: rewrite task briefs / execution_strategy / visual_map so the old project becomes v1.0-readable.
4. Report the recommended mode, rationale, expected write scope, estimated token/time cost, risks, and whether subagents are needed.
5. Ask me the confirmation questions you need, then wait for my confirmation before writing files.

During the scan phase, run at least:
npx --yes coding-agent-harness status --json .
npx --yes coding-agent-harness migrate-plan --json --limit 1000 .

When the migration is complete, report the dashboard HTML, session.json, normal/strict checks, migrate-plan summary, and whether full-cutover verification passes.
```
