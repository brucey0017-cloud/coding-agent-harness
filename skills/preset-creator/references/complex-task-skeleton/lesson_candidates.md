# {{TASK_TITLE}} - Lesson Candidates

This file is the task-local lesson candidate queue. Human review decides whether any candidate should stay task-local, be rejected, enter dry-run promotion, become a promoted lesson detail doc, or become a separate sedimentation task.

## Candidate Status

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Schema version | lesson-candidate-v1 |
| Task-level status | pending-review |
| Review gate | candidate-file-present |
| Review decision | pending-human-review |
| Promotion state | not-promoted |
| Closeout token | pending |
| Source task | {{TASK_ID}} |
| Owner | coordinator |
| Last updated | {{DATE}} |

## Schema

Allowed task-level status:

- `missing`: candidate file is absent.
- `pending-review`: candidate file exists, but human decision is not complete.
- `no-candidate-accepted`: human accepted the agent's no-candidate reason.
- `needs-promotion`: at least one candidate is queued for governance promotion.
- `promoted`: all accepted candidates were promoted to the agreed governance target.
- `rejected`: all candidates were rejected or archived with reasons.

Allowed row status:

- `ready-for-review`: agent believes this candidate may matter.
- `needs-promotion`: human marked the candidate worth preserving through dry-run promotion or a follow-up sedimentation task.
- `promoted`: maintenance CLI or an approved follow-up task promoted the candidate to the agreed governance target.
- `rejected`: human rejected the candidate with a reason.

Aggregation rule:

- Any `ready-for-review` row keeps task-level status `pending-review`.
- Any `needs-promotion` row sets task-level status `needs-promotion` unless another row is still `ready-for-review`.
- All rows `promoted` sets task-level status `promoted`.
- All rows `rejected` sets task-level status `rejected`.
- A no-candidate task must use task-level status `no-candidate-accepted` and fill `No-Candidate Reason`.

## Candidates

| ID | Row Status | Title | Scope | Module Key | Detail Artifact | Boundary Reason | Why It Might Matter | Review Decision | Promotion Target | Conflict Check | Required Standard Update | Follow-up Task |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## No-Candidate Reason

Not decided yet. Fill this only when review accepts that the task produced no reusable lesson candidate.

## Promotion Notes

- If human review decides a candidate is worth preserving, mark the row `needs-promotion` and record the target governance location.
- If a candidate is marked `needs-promotion`, write the full task-local detail artifact while the source task context is fresh, then link it in `Detail Artifact`.
- Use `Scope` values `task`, `module`, or `global`; module-scoped candidates must fill `Module Key`.
- If human review rejects a candidate, mark the row `rejected` and keep the reason in the review decision.
- `needs-promotion` does not block task closeout, but it must remain visible in the maintenance queue and closeout record.
- Default promotion behavior is dry-run or follow-up-task first. Do not write a shared Lessons table; accepted candidates become promoted lesson detail docs.
- A sedimentation task must classify scope, check conflicts against existing lessons and standards, propose the target change, and report verification before applying.

## Queue Routing

| Queue | When this task enters it | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lessons | Any candidate is `ready-for-review` or `needs-promotion`. | Human rejects it, keeps it task-local, creates a sedimentation task, or approves promotion. |
| Missing Materials | The file is absent, has invalid status, or lacks a required no-candidate reason. | Agent repairs the candidate file. |
| Confirmed / Finalized | Human review is confirmed but a candidate still has deferred governance work. | Follow-up task or dry-run decision is recorded. |
